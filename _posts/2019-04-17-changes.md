The first day of spring came almost 3 weeks ago now, but today really seemed like the day winter left for good. I just had my wisdom teeth removed, and I've had some time alone with my thoughts to really think about all that's happened in the last few years.

I started this blog almost 4 years ago now as a sophomore (seriously, why don't Canadians use this terminology?) studying medical sciences. Back then, I wanted to go to medical school and be a doctor, but it wasn't really the burning passion that my peers had. It was really just the most obvious path, in my head.

4 years later, I still don't know what I want to do. I applied to medical school several times now, and whether that will work out in the future is still a mystery. I'm almost done my Master's in Engineering (!?), and I don't know if I want to go back to school or not. I mean, I basically graduating from grade 17 -- 17 years of going to class, having my life completely structured around education.

But that's not all that bad, because I love learning. There are still so many things I want to learn that I haven't gotten around to. Although I think I'm okay with not returning to school next year. I'm excited to potentially find a job and start making a living. Yeah, your life is still centred around this social construct where you have to go and *work* 8 hours a day or something. But it'll be nice to have the rest of the time to really enjoy my life and not worry about the next exam or application.
