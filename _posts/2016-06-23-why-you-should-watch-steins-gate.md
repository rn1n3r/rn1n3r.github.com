title: Why you should watch Steins;Gate
---

At the beginning of second year, a bunch of my friends whom I was living with were going crazy over this new anime. A lot of my friends endulge in anime, and while I was never (and probably won't ever) be as crazy about it as they are, I enjoy anime and Japanese culture as well. The one other anime series I had finished was <em>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</em>, a universally acclaimed and highly recommended anime itself, so I guess my standards were really high going into <em>Steins;Gate</em>.
