title: Hey guys!
---

I don't think I've ever actually blogged before. I started a blogspot in 6th grade or something to post the homework, but that's about it. Regardless, I need an outlet to share and organize my thoughts, rants, and other ideas. 

As of the time of writing, I am a second-year student studying Medical Sciences at Western University. So obviously, I'll be blogging about a lot of school things; that is what my life is comprised of right now. Maybe some student following in my steps can find my experiences helpful, but I doubt it.

I'll also document other projects, endeavours and just random thoughts about life here. Just setting this thing up has taught me a lot about Git, Jekyll, and Poole (I'm using the Hyde theme of Poole to run this), and hopefully I can share some of what I've learned.

But I have an orgo exam to write soon, so I guess I'll just leave this post with this:
