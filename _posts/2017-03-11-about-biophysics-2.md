title: About Medical Biophysics (part 2)
published: true
---

The last two core third-year courses in the Biophysics program at Western have been keeping me busy this semester, among other things. In the spirit of completeness, here's an overview of what they're about:

1. Fundamentals of Digital imaging (3503): Another course split between 4 different professors, covering a very wide range of topics in medical imaging with an emphasis on general concepts that are applicable to many different imaging modalities. 

	The first part of the course started with an overview of imaging science and how its role in medicine, including looking at SNR, contrast, and ROC curves. In particular, learning about ROC curves and other ways of quantifying imaging techniques was useful because they were translatable to other things like classifiers in machine learning. Fun fact: the ROC curve originated from the battlefields of World War II, where it was used to quantify enemy detection.
