title: Learning Git
---

Today I decided to revisit this. One thing that I really wanted to do is to learn how to use Git. In the past, I used Github's desktop app for Windows, but I always found that it was very confusing and slow. I've been using the new Window's Subsystem for Linux a lot recently, and decided to just sudo apt-get git (I should probably just download git for Windows, but whatever). Along with [this link](http://tutorialzine.com/2016/06/learn-git-in-30-minutes/) I saw on Hacker News (or Reddit? I don't remember), I understand how Git works a lot more now, and I'm actually loving the tool. Maybe one day I'll be a Git master, but right now I'm just happy that I know how to commit and push things without too much hassle.
