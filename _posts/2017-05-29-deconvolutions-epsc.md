title: Deconvolutions and EPSCs

So at the research lab I'm working in this summer, the field of study is in neuroscience. And while that's relatively new and unknown territory for me, I have tried my best to learn and to bring my own experiences and skills to the new problems I face.

#EPSCs

Part of what I'm doing involves investigating electrical properties of neurons in the spinal cord. Neurons communicate with each other at junctions called chemical synapses. At these junctions, neurotransmitters are released from one neuron (the presynaptic neuron), which causes a change in the receptors on the postsynaptic neuron, causing a flow of ions into the cell. In this way,  a neuron receives inputs from many other neurons.

To look at these inputs, the **current clamp**
$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
