Welcome to my blog: here I will write about my thoughts. It's quite technical right now, with a focus on the challenges I face in school and with my research, but that might change.

My name is Edward, and I'm a third-year student at Western University. I'm studying Medical Biophysics, but I'm interested in all things science and tech related. I'm not a very interesting person, but blogging helps me sort out my thoughts. My hope is that one day, one of my posts will be able to help someone out.
