Scribbles wander across the sheets and pages,  
Whispers tangled within the chaotic mess  
What must be said cannot be written,  
For there is uncertainty in the air  
Breaths strangle in their race to finish,  
Every last word, every last thought 

Within these incomprehensible lines 
Lies the value of love unknown  
It is the life of words that cannot be scribed  
Only said with messy scribbles
